(Cold)

I hope you leave and don't come back
'Cause I'm cold, oh, oh
Baby, I'm cold, oh, oh

Baby, I'm
Still cold
Cold like I'm seein' my breath
After the season you left

Baby, I'm stuck in my ways
They say the coldest hearts are hardest to break
That's probably how I ended up in this place
With no emotion left to process the pain
It's better this way (yeah)

Too numb to feel it burn
Too numb to let it hurt
I stare at my reflection
I don't recognize myself

I'm too numb to feel the pain
Too numb to feel a thing
You watched me bleed
I hope you leave and don't come back

'Cause I'm cold, oh, oh
Baby, I'm cold, oh, oh
I hope you leave and don't come back
'Cause I'm-

Call me on the phone, but I'm outta range
When I'm all up in the mountain ranges
And I know you won't put this on your playlist
Show your friends all mad I'm keepin' you nameless

I was down bad for you from the jump
Thought you were the one, now I gotta regain my trust
Matter fact, I don't trust no one, left me in the dust
Got me outta touch with emotions (yeah)

I'm too numb to feel the pain (too numb to feel the pain)
Too numb to feel a thing (ah)
You watched me bleed
I hope you leave and don't come back

'Cause I'm cold
I hope you leave and don't come back
'Cause I'm cold
You watched me freeze and turned your back on me

So don't hit my line (don't hit my line)
Don't waste your time (don't waste your time)
I'm too far gone

Yeah, I swear that I'm cold
I hope you leave and don't come back
'Cause I'm cold

I hope you leave and don't come back
'Cause I'm cold
I hope you leave and don't come back
'Cause I'm-
